# Seperating People, Love bombing and Gaslighting
## 1st Handwritten Section

## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction-8)
- [Chapter 1: Love Bombing](#chapter-1-love-bombing)
- [Chapter 2: Gaslighting](#chapter-2-gaslighting)
- [Chapter 3: Separation](#chapter-3-seperation)

## Introduction

About Seperating people by casual deception, misinformations, building trust and establish rapport by love bombing and gaslighting to make someone question their reality, and at the end we will discuss a little plan which you can expand upon and make it better, to separate two close friends, just for fun! (No sadistic intentions)

# Chapter 1: Love Bombing

Love bombing is a powerful tool to build trust and establish rapport, here how you can love bomb someone and a diabolic trick at the end to make them run after you

### Step 1 - The compliments

Compliment them for the smallest things, spend a lot of time with them, understand their emotions and position yourself as the only person they can depend on, trust, be honest, express themselves, but don't make it too obvious, connect with them deeply inside, emtional (mabye spiritually even? if that's possible...)

### Step 2 - More Trust

Now that you've connected with them deeply inside, build more trust and make them want to talk to you, make them laugh and bring positive emotions and support them, here's a trick but use it carefully as it can mabye put you on danger too - Share a secret with them, and the person will be more open to you, indirectly  make them tell a secret or two, and be careful not to reveal your acutal and embarrassing secrets and lead to you downfall eventually, now you can use techniques like blackmailing here, but its your choice, and be careful sometimes it can be illegal

### Step 3 - Ghost them

Now ghost them, don't talk until they talk, make them feel a little lonely, but not too much, and then use this to make them keep reaching out to you, make them dependent on you, and now that their dependent, start gaining power and control over them and that's all

### Step 4 - Collect the Data

Data is key! Get the most out of them, like embarrassing secrets, illegal and unethical activites done by them, and as I mentioned the trick you can use earlier to get their secrets, use it while keeping yourself safe, and did you know? most people are open and most likely to tell their secrets at night, and if you suspect someone is lying, just give them a stare in complete silence, and most likely they'll reveal it

### Step 5 - POWER

Now that you got the juicy information, use it against them and gain complete control over them, but this can be illegal, you can force them like to your needs and do whatever but this mostly depends on what kind of and level of vulnerability of the secrets, the key is to stay patient and get the most data you can

## Chapter 2: Gaslighting

Gaslighting can be illegal and most likely is, it can make someone question their own reality and sometimes if used right can make someone miserable and feeling severe emotions that could cause nerve damage, but probably I'm just exaggerating... Now without wasting time I'll explain how it's done let's start with an example

### Imagine

One day, I meet you we're friends and your talking about your first birthday, and as a teenager or and adult you most likely would have forgetten you 1st year birthday completely, and I say that I was at your birthday, and a question sparks up in your head "Was he there? or not?" a dilemma, and you say like "I think so... I was holding a red balloon, right?" and I go like "No, you were holding a blue balloon" and you deny and we both start a little arguing and then I strongly say "I am 100% sure, that you had a blue ballon not a red balloon" I'd say like you don't remember it and other lies, when it was actually a red balloon, you could also say pink as it is more closer to red and more likely to make the person believe it, but that's a other story, so your most likely going to believe it or rarely no, but when I bring in some friends of ours and make them say its a blue one, you have a higher chance of believing this

Now that example is small scale, and if your a older person your more vulnerable, if we you want you can increase from simple white lies to complex schemes, and if you understood this completely, you can see the true potential of this, you can make someone question there own reality, make them go insane, the possibilities are ENDLESS!

## Chapter 3: Separation

Now with some tricks up your sleeve, and more studying you can make your own plan, but before that let's explore separating people, just for the fun of it (or mabye for other intentions)

Let's say one of your friends, and another friend of theirs exist for some reason... Sometimes your just left out... Imagine it, lonely, akward, the pain of ignorance... But your not a emotional idiot are you? are atleast I'm not, most of time... Now their just took close for their own good, your left out! You have to gain dominance, you can use simple and complex lies, spread rumors and misinformation when their not around, but be careful this has to be done without anyones notice or suspect and carfully, its a delicate process, tell your friend when this friend is not there, you can use many lies, like he's betraying you, secretly  hates you, spreads rumors about you, use some gaslighting here too, and along with the process use love bombing too, slowly but surely break their trust, and relationship, a key tool is humor, use humor in disguise and make a lot of rumors staying anonymous, fuel conflict between this two, stay neutral if possible which may not be possible sometimes, then pick a side if things get a little out of hand but don't immediately try to stay neutral, keep doing this until there relationship is broken, and build yours, after a while when they both are no longer in relationship anymore, love bomb them, and gain power and control, use method in this section mentioned above, make a full-proof plan and spread your dominance!

            <summary>The Brainwashing [Handwritten]</summary>

#### Warning : Use at your own risk! Not really. I don't care. Do whatever you want; it's your wish, but I'm not responsible.

# Introduction

You will learn about brainwashing STEP-BY-STEP, you won't get this anywhere else, plus this is all free, so save this as a HTML, text, image, or a pdf file before it gets removed!

# The guide

If you haven't go check out the gaslighting guide from the previous section already, so let's continue after you've reviewed that, and also develop your damn LYING/DECEPTION SKILLS! you have to lie better...
So this is how (in a step-by-step guide)

### Step 1 - Breaking down of Self
Systematically attack the victim's sense of themself, say things like "You are not worthy", "You are not a man", these things will stay in their minds for days to months. Well,  if the victim has a lot of confidence and self-esteem, do it more, and gaslight them into questioning their decisions. here's a small trick, limit their decisions.

Instead of saying, "How much are you willing to donate?" ask like "Are you giving 120$ or 45$", I included another trick here known as anchoring, I give them a big price first and a reasonable price compared to a big price. instead of the first question, where they can just deny or give like 2$, I gave them two options, which increases their choice being those two by more than approx. 50-80% but certainly will work on small decisions rather than life-changing ones

Now back to the original topic, you should make the victim as confused as possible, and make them question their decisions and making them dependent on an external source like you. you have to make them into a nihilistic state, and forget who they are. basically, this can be done through repeated gaslighting, deception, etc... or sometimes through normal verbal communication! but don't expect anything yet! there is still more, continue reading...

### Step 2 - More Sabotage
Now that you've done some good sabotage, they enter a stage of guilt, and your goal is to amplify it, make them forget their identity, make them have a identity crisis, and lower their self-esteem. Again,  this can be done through subtle and systematical blaming, gaslighting, and a spice of love bombing (in the previous section).

Now you made them think they were guilty, and now you give the victim as much pain as possible; physical and mental combined are the best (and like peer pressure, betrayal, etc...), make them forget their old identity, and make sure to be subtle. Isolation is key; isolate them from their loved ones, family, friends, and everyone else, basically except you.

### Step 3: Remodel
Now that the victim is in great depression and has lost themselves, present yourself as the person who can fix it all, bring light into their dark life, but not that quickly; let them have their personal space and stay away for a while; let them sink deep into their feelings; and when they're at their breaking point, start guiding them and subtly remodelling their thought patterns; don't hurry; don't get caught; and most importantly, establish rapport and gain their deepest trust.

### Step 4: Don't let them forget yet.
Don't let them forget their old mistakes or how they felt shame and guilt; remind them, but not too much that causes pain; make it stay within a limit; leave subtle references about their mistakes; and don't let them lose trust in you.

### Step 5: Forget the past
Make them know that the past identity was a worse version and always inflicted pain, and guide them to their new identity, how you want them to be, gaslight them, and finally love bomb them once and for all. After this, they'll trust you too much for their own good, be dependent on you, and let you take control.

      <summary>Assertiveness [Handwritten]</summary>

# Introduction

A simple guide to being assertive, without assertiveness you cannot get the things you desire, and be anxious all the time, zero confidence, and you don't want to be like that and you have to get better at socializing and communication, etc... So, follow this guide to become assertive, and get better at socializing, etc...

### Step 1: Balance assertiveness

Assertiveness needs a delicate balance, if its too low, people won't listen to you and you'll fail, if its too high, people won't like you, and sometimes deny your orders, you shouldn't invade their boundaries, and you should be charismatic, and socialize well.

### Step 2: Know your RIGHTS

Most people know their rights, but sometimes they get scared, and feel guilty, empathize or sympathize too much, or think its too mean or little mean when its not, here is a list of rights you should not be guilty of, or think its mean

- It’s your right to change your mind when ever you want
- It’s your right to not justify your behavior with excuses
- It’s your right to be illogical in your decision-making
- It’s your right to say, “I don’t know.”
- It’s your right to decide which of other people’s problems you have a responsibility to solve.
- It’s your right to say, “I don’t care.”
- It’s your right to express your opinions, no matter what
- It’s your right to decide whats best for you
- It’s your right to not believe in god, or other philosophical ideas
- It’s your right to be rebellious
- It’s your right to be Unique
- It’s your right to do what you want

### Step 3: Confidence

Build up your confidence, for this you'll need to use exposure therapy which works on all people (almost), so this is repeatedly putting yourself in situtations which give you the anxiety and lack of confidence, but I'm not telling you to go jump in a high-stakes argument which you don't know anything about, start with small things, like talking to a random stranger, or just socializing more, making new friends, and make the task harder as time goes on, soon you'll not feel a lack of confidence, or that social anxiety, and surround yourself with like-minded individuals, join socializing places like clubs

### Step 4: Learn to say no

Start saying No, when you have to... If you have followed the last steps, you'd have the confidence and you'll know your rights + no feel guilty, again don't feel guilty and just get into action without overthinking, but still think but not overthink, and don't have that tension/stress build up

Don't say "I'm sorry" too much, it lowers your power and respect, but it also earns you respect, so don't avoid it completely, but don't say it unnecessarily, not for all things, try to replace it with "Thank You", or similar like example, you take a little long to come to a meeting, so instead of saying "Sorry, I am late" start saying "Thank you for your patience", this shifts the focus from you being late and thanking them, so they feel it's not a bad thing and feel great, just a small (manipulation?) trick

### Step 5: Set boundaries and keep it Simple

Setting bounaries is one of the most important skills, learn your rights, if you think your being manipulated and sure about it, set boundaries, be frank about it to them, or if you feel like it cut off the relationship, avoid toxic relations, friends or fake ones, and most of all, don't stress it, it's not that quick and easy to become assertive, it's not a thing you can achieve overnight, don't worry about it, stay calm and relaxed, just go with what you gut tells you
